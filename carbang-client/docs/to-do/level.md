- [ ] Players with unloaded skin should display something else temporarily until loaded (maybe a blanket car)
- [ ] Level endpoints render a transparent gradient transitioning from nothing to black over the map.
- [ ] Non-teleport level endpoints contribute invisible walls
- [ ] Teleport level endpoints cause teleport
- [ ] Car labels minimize long usernames with '...'. The username character limit is 25. If the suffix of the username is a number, it serves as a distinguishment between other players with the same name.
- [ ] Shark car
