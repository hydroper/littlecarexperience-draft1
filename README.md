# CarBang with Next.js + Two.js + Godot Engine

A failure by @hydroper on trying to develop a massive multiplayer game with the following technologies:

* Front-end
  * Next.js
  * Two.js
* Backend
  * Godot Engine

There are several troubles to handle with this technology combination:

* WebSocket bugs; something strange to do with the peer dictionary is going on in the Godot Engine backend.
* The Two.js rendering library's API is not rich in options.
